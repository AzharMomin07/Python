NUMPY
	 
	 
	 
	 Numpy have a scientefically packages that are used to Mathematical opration
    
     it is also give us multidimetional array's	
	 
	 Numpy provides efficient storage 
	 
	 It is fast
	 numpy used reletivly less memory to store data 
	 
	 NUMPY have more mathematical opration:-
	 
	 mathematicale ,logic ,shape,sorting,selecting ,i/o,discrete Fouriour transform,basic linear algebra,basic staticale opration,random simulation,and more
	 
	 
	 Python List vs Numpy Arrays
	 
	 1) Data Type Storage:-
	 in list we store multiple type of data and also multiple data
	 &
	 in numpy we store also  same as list but it is not possible for hire calculation so tht time we choose only one data type
	 
	 list is good for this 
	 
	 2) importing module
	 
	 in list it is bydefault in python we direct used it.
	 &
	 numpy when we wnt to used it we import it first.
	 
	 
	 3) Numerical Opration
	 
	  list is capable but less efficiency 
	 &
	 numpy is a work as matrix array so we use all matrix opration 
	 
	 4) modification
	 
	 in list modification is fast becaused multiple tool available
	 &
	 numpy is less tool available for modification
	 
	 
	 5) Consume memory
	 
	 list is consume more memory
	 &
	 numpy is consume less memory
	 
	 6) Fast
	 
	 list is not fast
	 &
	 numpy is faster than list 
	 
	 7)convienent used
	 
	 list not used more data
	 &
	 numpy work to high data  also
	 
	 
	 
	 we check time of exicution using
	 
	 % timeit  -one line
	 %% timeit - total program
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 if you want to check how many dimetional array then you used 
	 
	 ndim -fuction
	 
	 create numpy arraya with Random Arrays
	 
	1 rand(): the function is used to generate a random value between 0 to 1.
	 
	2 randn():- this fuction provide number near zero to one it's positive also negative
	
	
	                                      ***** Data Types in numpy *****

     int :-     int 8,16,32,64
     boolean :-	True,False
     intc
     intp
     int8	 
	 int16
	 int32
	 int64
	 uint8 -unsigned data 0 to 255 data can be store
	 -
	 -
	 uint64
	 float
	 float16
	 -
	 float64
	 complex_
	 complex64
	 complex128
	 
	 ***************** Arithematic Opration in numpy **************************
	 
	 a+b    np.add(a,b)
	 a-b    np.substract(a,b)
	 a*b    np.multiply(a,b)
	 a/b    np.divide(a,b)
	 a%b    np.mod(a,b)
	 a**b   np.power(a,b)
	 2/b    np.reciprocal(b)
	 
	 
	 
	 ***** Slicing in array *****
     get perticuler data set in array 
      a=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   index 0  1  2  3  4	
        a[]   
     start:stop:step
